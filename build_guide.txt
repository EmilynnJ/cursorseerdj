SoulSeer Final Production Build Guide (Feb 2026, Django Monolith Version) 

 

0) Objective 

 

Build the production-ready, app-store deployable SoulSeer platform. This is not a demo, MVP, or scaffold. It must be secure, fully functional, and deployable. 

 

Strict Directive: No Mock Anything 

 

No placeholders, mock data, dummy logic, stubs, or simulated integrations. 

 

No hardcoded “fake” profiles, fake sessions, fake Stripe events, or “coming soon” UI. 

 

All flows must be real, end-to-end. 

 

 

 

--- 

 

1) Product Overview 

 

SoulSeer is a premium platform connecting spiritual readers with clients for: 

 

On-demand pay-per-minute sessions (text/voice/video) 

 

Scheduled flat-rate sessions 

 

Livestreaming + gifting 

 

Marketplace (digital + physical) 

 

Messaging + community 

 

Role-based dashboards for Client / Reader / Admin 

 

 

About Page Copy (must use verbatim) 

 

> At SoulSeer, we are dedicated to providing ethical, compassionate, and judgment-free spiritual guidance. Our mission is twofold: to offer clients genuine, heart-centered readings and to uphold fair, ethical standards for our readers. 

Founded by psychic medium Emilynn, SoulSeer was created as a response to the corporate greed that dominates many psychic platforms. Unlike other apps, our readers keep the majority of what they earn and play an active role in shaping the platform. 

SoulSeer is more than just an app—it's a soul tribe. A community of gifted psychics united by our life's calling: to guide, heal, and empower those who seek clarity on their journey.

--- 

 

3) Architecture Decision (Simplified, Low-Ops, Production) 

 

Core Principle 

 

Minimize moving parts. Use a Django monolith and managed realtime services. 

 

Required Stack (Final) 

 

Backend 

 

Django (monolith) 

 

Django REST Framework (only where needed: mobile clients, external service callbacks, internal APIs) 

 

Celery for background jobs (payout batching, webhook processing, session finalization) 

 

Redis for Celery broker/cache 

 

 

Frontend 

 

Django Templates + Tailwind CSS 

 

HTMX for dynamic UX (filters, inbox updates, dashboards, modals) 

 

Alpine.js only if truly needed for small UI behaviors 

 

 

Database 

 

Neon Postgres (primary DB) 

 

 

Auth Choose ONE: 

 

Option A: Auth0 (fastest, stable, less auth footguns) 

 

Option B: Django Allauth (cheaper, full control, more work) 

 

 

Realtime Media (WebRTC + Livestream) 

 

Agora SDK for voice/video + livestream 

 

 

Signaling / Session Sync Choose ONE (do not run two parallel systems): 

 

Option A (recommended for simplicity): Agora RTM for signaling + chat events 

 

Option B: Ably for signaling/state events (keep everything else the same) 

 

 

Payments 

 

Stripe Connect (reader payouts, platform fees) 

 

Stripe Checkout / Payment Intents for wallet top-ups (no card data stored) 

 

 

Storage 

 

Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible) for digital downloads + uploads 

(Backblaze B2 is acceptable alternative) 

 

 

Observability 

 

Sentry for error tracking 

 

UptimeRobot for uptime checks 

 

 

 

--- 

 

4) Navigation Structure (Final) 

 

Home 

 

Readers (search/filter) 

 

Reader Profile (rates, availability, reviews, schedule) 

 

About 

 

Live (streams) 

 

Shop 

 

Community (forums) 

 

Messages (unified inbox) 

 

Dashboard (role-based) 

 

Help Center 

 

Profile / Settings 

 

Auth pages (login/signup/logout) 

 

 

 

--- 

 

5) Non-Negotiable Core Systems 

 

SoulSeer has 3 “pillars.” Build them in this order: 

 

Pillar A: Wallet + Ledger (Must Be Bulletproof) 

 

Rule: Never compute billing as “timer * rate” without ledger entries. 

 

Wallet Ledger Requirements 

 

Every money movement is a row: 

 

top-up, session charge, gift, refund, adjustment, payout, commission 

 

 

Every ledger entry has: 

 

idempotency key 

 

timestamps 

 

references to user, session, stripe event/payment intent 

 

 

Must reconcile against Stripe events 

 

 

Acceptance Criteria 

 

Wallet balance always equals sum(ledger) 

 

Stripe webhooks are idempotent (store processed event IDs) 

 

Refunds and chargebacks never corrupt balances 

 

 

 

--- 

 

Pillar B: Session State Machine (On-Demand PPM) 

 

State machine (source of truth in Django DB): 

 

created → waiting → active → paused → reconnecting → ended → finalized 

 

include grace windows + timeout rules 

 

 

Billing 

 

Deduct per minute via scheduled tick OR server-authoritative timestamps 

 

Ledger entries created for each billable minute segment 

 

If balance hits zero: auto-pause/end according to spec 

 

 

Reconnection 

 

grace period enforced 

 

prevention of “disconnect fraud loops” 

 

session summary recorded 

 

 

Acceptance Criteria 

 

Reconnect does not double-bill 

 

Disconnect cannot create free minutes beyond grace 

 

Session cannot end without final ledger reconciliation 

 

 

 

--- 

 

Pillar C: Realtime Media (Agora) 

 

Client joins Agora channel only when session is valid and funded 

 

Tokens are short-lived, generated server-side 

 

Livestream uses Agora streaming mode (public/private/premium) 

 

 

Acceptance Criteria 

 

No valid token without session authorization 

 

Stream access rules enforced (premium gating) 

 

 

 

---

rapid disconnect/reconnect loops 

 

low balance mid-session 

 

webhook delays

6.2 Scheduled Readings (Flat Rate) 

 

Reader sets weekly availability (repeating) 

 

Client books:

Acceptance Criteria

Cancellation/refund rules are enforceable and auditable

6.3 Live Streaming + Gifts 

 

Public, private, premium streams 

 

Gift purchases: 

 

client spends wallet OR Stripe purchase that credits wallet then spends 

 

 

Gifts trigger animations + ledger entry 

 

Payout split: 70/30, tracked in ledger 

 

 

Acceptance Criteria 

 

Gift always produces ledger entry 

 

Reader earnings visible and reconciled 

 

 

 

--- 

 

6.4 Messaging (Free + Paid Reply) 

 

Clients can always message readers for free

12) Final “No AI Shortcut” Directive 

 

If a spec is unclear: flag explicitly and propose options. 

 

Never invent features or fake flows “for scaffolding.” 

 

Every user journey must be tested end-to-end before moving forward.
